 play eclipse - to generate project files
 play run - to compile the project and start a server with the application 
  listening at port 9000
 play debug run - same as above but starts the application in debug mode
 play update-classifiers - downloads sources and javadoc for 3rd party libs
 
3) Setup mongodb
Install MongoDB and run mongo server via "mongod" (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/).
Run the scripts from db_scripts folder sequentially. 
You can run a script either by running "mongo" and then pasting the contents of the file
or by running "mongo path_to_the_file/name_of_the_file.js". After that the setup for the 
application is complete.

The application uses MongoDB Java Driver (https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver).
